This is a repository for my various electronic hobby projects.

So far (and for the predictable future) I'm a total noob so the "projects" are more like demo circuits from "teach yourself electronics" books and so on. Some of those books are in Polish, so some project names will be in Polish too.

In addition, this repo will contain my libraries for EDA software that I use. For now this is:
* **KiCad** - here, I have my own generic symbol library mostly for the looks, because I'm a stickler for a resistor looking just like I want it to look in the schematic etc. Waste of time (standard KiCad libraries are perfectly serviceable), but hey, it's a hobby, not a job.
* **VeeCad** - this is an awesome program to design layouts for stripboard (sometimes know as veroboard), which is a nice option if you don't want to faff with fabricating custom PCBs just yet.
